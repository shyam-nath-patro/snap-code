/* Write a program to generate the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer n. Starting with any positive integer n, Collatz sequence is defined corresponding to n as the numbers formed by the following operations :

If n is even, then n = n / 2.
If n is odd, then n = 3*n + 1.
Repeat above steps, until it becomes 1.
Input Format

A single integer n.
Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
Output Format

A single line containing the sequence of numbers, separated by a ( -> ). */
